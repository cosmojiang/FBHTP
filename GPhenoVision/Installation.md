# GPhenoVision

GPhenoVision is a ground mobile system with multi-modal imaging for field-based high throughput phenotyping. You can access details through our paper https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19142-2. Currently, we use this system for genetics/genomics studies and breeding programs for flowering crops such as cotton and Brassica. This folder contains necessary information to install and configure the LabVIEW based data acquisition software.
